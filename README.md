# Memory Game Project

## Instructions

Click on a card to flip it over, revealing its symbol.

If two cards match they will lock in place.

Keep flipping until all cards are matched.

Games are timed and performance is rated using a star rating system.
The more moves you make, the fewer stars you will receive.

The total number of moves you made, time you took and stars you received will be diplayed at the end of the game.
